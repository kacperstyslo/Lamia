# Lamia

## Description
The script I created allows you to thoroughly scan the network you are connected to, obtain credentials using the key capture module, the intercepted data will be sent to the e-mail address of your choice. The module will also allow you to quick generate a set of passwords which you can use to brute force attacks and allow you to connect to devices outside your network.
